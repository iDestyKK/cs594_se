# cs594\_se (Fall 2020)

## Synopsis
This is Bioinformatics taught by Dr. Scott Emrich. This repo will contain my
tools and work for challenges and homework assignments. They both have their
own respective development branches (`dev/challenges` and `dev/homework`
respectively).

In each directory, there is an additional `README.md` that details how every
assignment is structured. They also feature a checklist of assignments
completed.

## A Note on Programming Language Choice
All programs here are written in **C**, valid with the `--std=gnu89` flag
enabled `gcc`. We were allowed to choose any language as long as the TA could
run the submitted code. I ***do not*** recommend C for this class. I'm just a
masochist who enjoys turning C into a weapon. By that, I mean I used CNDS
(**C**lara **N**guyen's **D**ata **S**tructures) to skip a lot of the hard
work and use my favourite language effectively. Use Python like a normal
person, or even C++. They are much more appropriate, and will make your life
much easier.

Programs in the homework and challenges were written with expandability in
mind. I'm glad I made that choice, since they were easy to modify for future
assignments, as well as exam questions. It'll look like some severe
over-engineering, but it ended up being a real time saver in the long run. :)
