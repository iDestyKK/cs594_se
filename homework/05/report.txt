SUBMISSION DETAILS

  Before we begin, this submission contains several directories. For the sake
  of simplicity, "sec" is the source code to the programs this assignment
  requests. "lib" contains CNDS (Clara Nguyen's Data Structures), which is a
  collection of C libraries written entirely by me. All code here (libraries or
  not) is entirely my own work.

  The data files the assignment requires are stored in "data". My apologies if
  storing them in a directory causes any problems.

  There is a makefile supplied with this submission. To compile every program,
  simply run "make". Every executable will be put into the "bin" directory.

  This is written in C and adheres to the GNU89 standard (C89 with GNU
  extensions). Compilation was tested on UTK's EECS Hydra machines.


PROBLEMS (due 11/14)

  1. Download the small sample set of sequences from the course website.


     ok



  2. Modify your previous global alignment code to compute the Hamming distance
     (number of mismatches) between all pairs of sequences in the small sample
     ignoring indels. Output the resulting sample matrix to the screen, and
     place the program, the sample set, and instructions to compile/run this
     code in your dropbox (5 points)


     To compile, simply run the following command in the same directory as the
     supplied "makefile":

         UNIX> make



     Two executables, named "fasta_split" and "hamming_matrix" will be compiled
     and stored in the "bin" directory. These will be used for this problem.

     First, run "fasta_split" on "data/small.fasta.txt". This will split it
     into 5 separate fasta files (as that file contains 5 sequences in it):

         UNIX> ./bin/fasta_split data/small.fasta.txt seq


     This will create "seq0.fasta", "seq1.fasta", ... , "seq4.fasta" in the
     current working directory. Now, put these into "hamming_matrix" via EITHER
     of the commands:

         UNIX> ./bin/hamming_matrix -s seq{0..4}.fasta 2 -1 -2

         UNIX> ./bin/hamming_matrix -s seq0.fasta seq1.fasta seq2.fasta seq3.fasta seq4.fasta 2 -1 -2


     They both do the same thing. And they should output the following matrix:

           0   1  15  16  14
           1   0  14  15  13
          15  14   0   1   1
          16  15   1   0   2
          14  13   1   2   0


     For your convenience, the results of "fasta_split" are stored in the
     included "data/small_split", just in case the executable doesn't work.



  3. Generate by hand the distance-based tree for the small set of sequences
     using the UPGMA algorithm. You may either hand in your answer as a
     hardcopy in Prof. Emrich's mail box or as an ecopy in your dropbox (8
     points).



  4. Download and install the phylip package 
     (http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/) and the larger set of
     sequences from the course website. All programs below are part of phylip.


     ok



  5. Generate a distance-based tree using phylip for the larger dataset using
     both KITSCH and NEIGHBOR. You will need to compute a distance matrix first
     using DNADIST. Place the raw tree files into your dropbox and briefly
     comment on differences if any. (5 points)



  6. Run the Clustal Omega multiple sequence alignment tool and one additional
     tool of your choice on the large dataset ($4) using this link:
     http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/. Place a text version of the resulting
     "alignment files" in your drop box (6 points) Are the trees largely
     similar compared to the KITSCH and NEIGHBOR on a quick glance (3 points)?
     Are they roughly similar to each other? (3 points)
