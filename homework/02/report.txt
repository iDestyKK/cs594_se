PROBLEMS: (due 9/15)

  1. Download the two genes mentioned in Problem #1 in Section 3.9 (X79493 and
     AY707088) from fruit fly and human, respectively.


     ok



  2. Write a program called "globalign" to compute the global alignment score
     of the two sequences above using the following parameters: +2 for a match,
     -1 for a mismatch, and -2 for a gap. Perform the traceback and display the
     alignment in a user-friendly format. Please place the source code in your
     submission, and tell the instructor how to compile and run it in an
     accompanying write up. (10 points)



  3. Compute the local alignment between X79493 and AY707088 using a modified
     program "localign". Perform the traceback and display the alignment in a
     userfriendly format. Submit your code with instructions on how to run and
     compile. Discuss in your write up how the local alignment compares to the
     global alignment from #2 (10 points).



  4. Compute just the score of the optimal end-gap free alignment of the two
     mitochondrial sequences from HW #1: NC_012920 and AF254446 in a third
     program called "egfalign." Traceback and display will not be required.



  5. BLAST the two sequences from #1 using the bl2seq utility at NCBI BLAST.
     Summarize the BLAST alignment in your writeup (alignment length, identity,
     evalue, etc.) and discuss how it confirms or refutes your result from #3
     (3 points).



  6. Download the "mystery" sequence from the course website. Report its BLAST
     hits using blastn and blastx at the NCBI website in your writeup (1 point
     each).



  7. Compute the end-gap free alignment of the two mitochondrial sequences from
     HW #1: NC_012920 and AF254446 using only linear space. Report the score
     using the scheme used for problem #2 above (+2 match, -1 mismatch, -1 for
     a gap) in your writeup (6 points)
