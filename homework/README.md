# Homework Submissions Archive

## Synopsis
Here, you will find my homework for the course. These are the big assignments
that we were given two weeks to do.

## Directory Structure
You may notice, like in `dev/challenges` branch, that each homework submission
have their own directories like `bin`, `src`, `lib`, etc. Each submission is
treated as standalone. They do not depend on any files outside of their
directories. This is intentional, as each submission should compile on UTK's
Hydra/Tesla computers with a single `make` call. Though, this means libraries
like CNDS (Clara Nguyen's Data Structures) is included multiple times in this
repo.

### Submission Directory
There is a special directory, named `submit` which contains "master copies" of
submissions in `tar.xz` format. These are the exact archives that I submitted
on Instructure Canvas. These are generated by the `create_submission_tars.sh`
script in this directory. Each assignment directory has a `makefile` with a
special command to make a tar file. This is done via:
```bash
UNIX> make package
```
The script simply takes the `submit.tar.xz` created by `make package` and moves
it into `submit`.
