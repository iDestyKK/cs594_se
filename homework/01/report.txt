1. Review the honor code statement in the syllabus and read the accompying
   document. Please state in the accompanying writeup to this assignment that
   you have read and agree to the terms (2 points)

   I have read and agree to the terms.


2. Download the complete genomic sequence of bacteriophage lambda (accession
   NC_001416.1) and include it in your submission as “lambda.fasta” (1 points)

   ok


3. Write a small program to reverse complement the lambda genome. Save the new
   sequence with a FASTA header of “>reversed” and name the resulting file as
   "lambda.rev.fasta". Include this file and the source code in your
   submission, and instruct your instructor how to compile and run it in the
   accompanying write up called "report.txt" (5 points)


4. Write a small program that reports nucleotide frequencies and dinucleotide
   frequencies of lambda. Add instructions on how to run it and include your
   actual output in your write up (report.txt), and also include your code in
   the submission (5 points)


5. Download the human mitochondrial genome (NC_012920). Place it in your
   submission as "human_mito.fasta." Download the Neanderthal hypervariable
   region (AF254446). Save it in your submission as "neander_sample.fasta." (1
   points)


6. Write small programs to compute the log of the probability of the
   Neanderthal sequence under a multinomial model and a markov model of order
   3, both of which are trained from the human mitochondrial sequence. Place
   the code in your submission and report the results in your write up. (8
   points)


7. Generate a random sequence of 20,000 characters using a Markov model of
   order 3 trained on the human mitochondrial genome (you can start with your
   code from part #5). Place the code for this in your submission and tell your
   instructor how to run it in your write up. (8 points)
