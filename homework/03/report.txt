SUBMISSION DETAILS

  Before we begin, this submission contains several directories. For the sake
  of simplicity, "src" is the source code to the programs this assignment
  requests. "lib" contains CNDS (Clara Nguyen's Data Structures), which is a
  collection of C libraries written entirely by me. All code here (libraries or
  not) is entirely my own work.

  The fasta data files are stored in "data". My apologies if storing them in a
  directory causes any problems.

  There is a makefile supplied with this submission. To compile every program,
  simply run "make". Every executable will be put into the "bin" directory.

  This is written in C and adheres to the GNU89 standard (C89 with GNU
  extensions). Compilation was tested on UTK's EECS Hydra machines.


PROBLEMS: (due 9/29)

  1. Implement the dishonest casino Hidden Markov Model (HMM) similar to the
     one described on page 54 of Durbin. Assume the casino is always fair at
     the start (i.e., at t=0, Pr(F) = 1 & Pr(L) = 0), and shifts to another
     state with probability 0.05. Generate a random sequence of 300 rolls based
     on this model. Please submit the code and instructions how to run in your
     submission; a particular instance of 300 rolls in your submission is
     optional (8 points).


     To compile, simply run the following command in the same directory as the
     supplied "makefile":

         UNIX> make



     An executable, named "odc_seq_gen" will be compiled and stored in the
     "bin" directory. This is the executable we will use for this problem.

     The program allows you to specify the number of rolls and a seed. To run
     with 300 rolls where the seed is 1, run the following:

         UNIX> ./bin/odc_seq_gen 300 1



  2. Download the two particular instances available from the course website.


     ok



  3. Determine the probability of the benchmark files given the provided
     dishonest casino model. Please report the probabilities in your report and
     include your source code in your submission with instructions how to run
     it (10 points).


     The "make" instructions mentioned in Problem 1 will also compile the
     program for this problem. In this case, it's the "odc_forward", stored in
     the "bin" directory post-compilation.


     To run on both of the files given in #2, run the following commands:

         UNIX> ./bin/odc_forward data/hw3_1.txt
         UNIX> ./bin/odc_forward data/hw3_2.txt


     The runs will report the following:

         hw3_1.txt: 2.71995e-232
         hw3_2.txt: 1.93533e-232



  4. Determine the most likely state sequence of the benchmark files given the
     dishonest casino model of #2 using an implementation of the Viterbi
     algorithm. Please save the result as files "viterbi.1.txt" and
     "viterbi.2.txt" and label the states "F" and "L" as used in Figure 3.5 in
     Durbin. Please also include these result files and the source code in your
     submission (10 points).


     The "make" instructions mentioned in Problem 1 will also compile the
     program for this problem. In this case, it's the "odc_viterbi", stored in
     the "bin" directory post-compilation.


     To run on both of the files given in #2, and output resulting files
     discussed in the question, run the following commands:

         UNIX> ./bin/odc_viterbi data/hw3_1.txt viterbi.1.txt
         UNIX> ./bin/odc_viterbi data/hw3_2.txt viterbi.2.txt


     It will generate "viterbi.1.txt" and "viterbi.2.txt" in the root directory
     of the submission.


     For the sake of the question, these files have been run through
     "odc_viterbi" and their output text files are included in the "data"
     directory of this submission.



  5. Download two Anthrax strains from GenBank, the gold standard "Ames
     ancestor" that is virulent (NC_007530) and the non-virulent lab strain
     "Ames" (NC_003997).


     ok



  6. Visit the GLIMMer website
     (http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/glimmer/index.shtml). Read the release notes,
     information, and download the latest version.


     ok



  7. Run Glimmer3 on both genomes and include the output gene calls in your
     submission (4 pts each). Please do not include the genomes as they are
     large, but hold on to them wherever you are doing your work; these
     specific genomes will be the starting point for homework #4 after the
     midterm.
