PROBLEMS: (due 9/29)

  1. Implement the dishonest casino Hidden Markov Model (HMM) similar to the
     one described on page 54 of Durbin. Assume the casino is always fair at
     the start (i.e., at t=0, Pr(F) = 1 & Pr(L) = 0), and shifts to another
     state with probability 0.05. Generate a random sequence of 300 rolls based
     on this model. Please submit the code and instructions how to run in your
     submission; a particular instance of 300 rolls in your submission is
     optional (8 points).



  2. Download the two particular instances available from the course website.



  3. Determine the probability of the benchmark files given the provided
     dishonest casino model. Please report the probabilities in your report and
     include your source code in your submission with instructions how to run
     it (10 points).



  4. Determine the most likely state sequence of the benchmark files given the
     dishonest casino model of #2 using an implementation of the Viterbi
     algorithm. Please save the result as files "viterbi.1.txt" and
     "viterbi.2.txt" and label the states "F" and "L" as used in Figure 3.5 in
     Durbin. Please also include these result files and the source code in your
     submission (10 points).



  5. Download two Anthrax strains from GenBank, the gold standard "Ames
     ancestor" that is virulent (NC_007530) and the non-virulent lab strain
     "Ames" (NC_003997).



  6. Visit the GLIMMer website
     (http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/glimmer/index.shtml). Read the release notes,
     information, and download the latest version.



  7. Run Glimmer3 on both genomes and include the output gene calls in your
     submission (4 pts each). Please do not include the genomes as they are
     large, but hold on to them wherever you are doing your work; these
     specific genomes will be the starting point for homework #4 after the
     midterm.
